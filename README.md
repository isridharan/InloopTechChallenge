# InloopTechChallenge

Original Time Estimated: 

1.	University API   
Building Domain Model – 1 hour
Unit Test – 1hour
CQRS (Read Write API End points) – 1.5 hours

2.	Architecture Flow – 45 mins

3.	Reverse File Content (TDD using strategy pattern) – 1.5 hours

Actual Time Spent: 
1.	University API  
Building Domain Model and Validations and Unit Test – 3 hours (Partly reason for deviation couldn’t work continuously).

Skipped the API part of Persisting and Querying as Domain model forms the core of the solution and once that is finalised other Query/Persist operations can be performed around it.
